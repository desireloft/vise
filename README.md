# Vise Assembly

## Overview

This repository showcases a vise assembly designed in **SolidWorks** to demonstrate my skills in CAD modeling, assembly design, and technical documentation. The project includes a complete vise assembly, individual part models, technical drawings, and STEP files for interoperability. The design is optimized for manufacturing and prototyping, highlighting my ability to create functional mechanical assemblies for industrial applications.

## Project Details

The vise assembly is a mechanical clamping device designed for securing workpieces during machining, drilling, or assembly tasks. The project emphasizes proficiency in:

- SolidWorks modeling of complex parts and assemblies.
- Technical drawing creation for manufacturing.
- Exporting interoperable STEP files for collaboration or prototyping.
- Consideration of manufacturing processes (e.g., machining, casting) and rapid prototyping workflows.

### Components

The vise assembly consists of the following key models:

1. **Vise Assembly (`VISE ASSEMBLY`)**:
   - The complete assembly integrating all components.
   - Features an **exploded view** in the technical drawing to illustrate assembly sequence and component relationships.
2. **Base (`BASE`)**:
   - The stationary foundation of the vise, designed for stability and mounting to a workbench.
   - Optimized for casting or machining.
3. **Left Jaw (`LEFT JAW`)**:
   - Designed for durability and precise workpiece contact.
   - Includes features for smooth sliding and alignment.
4. **Right Jaw (`RIGHT JAW`)**:
   - Designed for durability and precise workpiece contact.
   - Includes features for smooth sliding and alignment.
   - Both right and left jaws are designed to be movable.
5. **Screw (`SCREW`)**:
   - The lead screw mechanism for adjusting the movable jaw.
   - Modeled with precise threading for functional operation.
6. **Handle & Wheel (`HANDLE & WHEEL`)**:
   - The component for manual operation of the screw.
   - Ergonomically designed for user comfort.

### Technical Drawings

- **Individual Part Drawings**:
  - Detailed drawings for each part (`BASE`, `LEFT JAW`, `RIGHT JAW`, `SCREW`).
  - Include dimensions and annotations for manufacturing.
- **Assembly Drawing**:
  - Comprehensive drawing for Vise Assembly with an exploded view.
  - Includes a **Bill of Materials (BOM)** listing all components and standard fasteners.
- **PDF Exports**:
  - All drawings are exported as PDFs for easy sharing and review (located in the `PDF/` folder).

### STEP Files

- STEP files (`.stp`) are provided for all parts and the assembly (`100222.stp`) to enable:
  - Interoperability with other CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, etc.).
  - Rapid prototyping (e.g., 3D printing).
  - Compatibility with CNC machining or other manufacturing processes.

### Note: Remaining part drawings will be updated
